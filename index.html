	<h1 style="color:darkblue;font-family:verdana;text-align:center;"> BMW M3</h1>
	<p style="color:darkblue;font-family:verdana;font-size:200%;text-align:center;">The BMW M3 is one of the most legendary performance sedans. First introduced in 1985, itâ€™s known for combining sharp handling, powerful engines, and everyday usability. Initially based on the BMW 3 Series, the M3 has evolved through several generations:

E30 (1985-1991): The original M3, with a 2.3L four-cylinder engine, was lightweight and track-ready, setting the standard for future M models.

E36 (1992-1999): Introduced a 3.0L inline-six, offering more power and refinement while keeping the agile driving experience intact.

E46 (2000-2006): Known for its perfect balance, it featured a 3.2L inline-six and became a favorite for enthusiasts due to its handling and power.

E90/E92 (2007-2013): The first M3 with a V8 engine (4.0L), it delivered 420 hp and had even more aggressive performance.

The BMW M3 continues to be a symbol of driving performance and BMW's motorsport heritage.
